to play in VLC:
===============
* Media > Open Network Stream...
  * Network URL: http://192.168.XXX.XXX:8080/

to play on Chromecast through VLC:
==================================
* Playback > Renderer
  * displays list of Chromecasts found in LAN
  * select one

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

observations:
=============
* the stream plays perfectly
* after several minutes, Streamlink encounters a problem:
    [stream.hls][error] Failed to create decryptor:
    Unable to open URL: https://key.livecamtv.me/RKUtex2CodYBuOkTGq6A/1534542841
   (444 Client Error:  for url: https://key.livecamtv.me/RKUtex2CodYBuOkTGq6A/1534542841)
* after this occurs,
  when the host website is revisited,
  the URL of the .m3u8 has changed ever so slightly:
    * the subdomains are numbered
    * the number of the subdomain has changed
* I'm not sure if the change of subdomain is a problem,
  or if the videos are simply being hosted by several identical servers,
  and this is load balance at play
* it seems more likely that it has something to do with pinging the host website,
  to keep the session active/alive
    * will need to run a test..
